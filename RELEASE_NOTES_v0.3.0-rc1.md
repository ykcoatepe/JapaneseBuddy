Release v0.3.0-rc1

Highlights

- New iPad-first NavigationSplitView UI with a clean sidebar
- Six original B1 lessons added on top of A1â€“A2 fundamentals
- Local audio packs with automatic fallback to TTS for shadowing segments
- Study streaks and weekly minutes tracking with a compact sparkline
- Expanded localization: English, Turkish, Japanese

Added

- Front-end redesign: NavigationSplitView, sidebar destinations, and theme application
- ThemeMode support and design tokens/components applied app-wide
- Six B1 lessons (B1-01 to B1-06) with objectives, shadowing, MCQs, and kanjiWords
- AudioEngine: local audio playback; Speaker fallback to TTS when files are missing
- Streaks and time tracking: minutesToday, weeklyMinutes, current/best streak
- Sparkline component and updated Home/Stats views
- Post-merge sanity tooling and reports to validate lessons/index and content structure

Improved

- Consistent typography, spacing, and interaction across views; reduced motion support
- Stats view shows a weekly minutes chart and best streak summary
- Stability: begin/end study session handling to avoid double counting and ensure clean backgrounding
- Localization coverage expanded (Base/en/tr/ja) for new Stats strings
- Backup/restore: compatibility maintained with new optional log fields (no migration required)

Fixed

- Avoid overlapping TTS and local audio by canceling TTS when local playback starts
- Lessons index sanity checks catch missing or malformed entries earlier

Docs

- README refreshed with screenshots grid (placeholders swapped to PNGs)
- docs/README.md added as a docs index; CONTRIBUTING.md and .markdownlint.yml
- Reports: REPORT-FE.md and REPORT-POSTMERGE.md for auditability
- Design system and pedagogy notes consolidated in documentation sections

Known issues

- Some labels in Stats may still be literal and need localization review
- Audio packs are optional; without them, TTS is used automatically (network/voice availability may vary)
- Screenshot PNGs are placeholders until final captures are added

Upgrade/Install (dev provisioning)

- No data migrations required; new fields added as optional
- If using local audio packs, include the audio resources folder in target Copy Bundle Resources
- Ensure Base/en/tr/ja .strings files are part of the app target
- Run the post-merge sanity script to validate lessons/index and content consistency before release

Thanks

Huge thanks to contributors who shaped the FE redesign, authored the B1 lessons, refined audio behavior, and helped verify localization and stats. Your feedback guided NavigationSplitView structure, ThemeMode application, and the learning flow polish.
