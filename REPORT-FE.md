# Front-End Audit Report

Date: 2025-09-11

## Summary
All acceptance criteria verified as present and functioning per code review. No code changes required. Optional cleanup noted below.

## Acceptance Verification

- App entry launches `AppSidebar`: PASS
  - `JapaneseBuddyProj/JapaneseBuddyProj/JapaneseBuddyProjApp.swift` initializes `AppSidebar` with environment objects, applies theme via `.applyTheme`, and sets `.tint`.

- ThemeMode persisted and applied at root: PASS
  - Persistence: `JapaneseBuddy/Services/DeckStore.swift` stores `themeMode` in `State` and loads/saves it.
  - Root application: `JapaneseBuddy/UI/Theme.swift` exposes `ThemeApplier` and `View.applyTheme(_:)` using `preferredColorScheme`. App root calls `.applyTheme(store.themeMode)`.

- UI tokens/components present and referenced: PASS
  - Tokens/components in `JapaneseBuddy/UI/Theme.swift` and `JapaneseBuddy/UI/Components/*` (e.g., `JBButton`, `JBCard`, `ProgressBar`) are used across feature views (e.g., Home, SRS).

- Reduce Motion guard in tracing view: PASS
  - `JapaneseBuddy/Features/KanaTraceView.swift` checks `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled` to gate animations/stroke previews.

- Haptics on trace pass and SRS grade: PASS
  - `JapaneseBuddy/Services/Haptics.swift` defines helpers (e.g., `Haptics.light()`); invoked in `KanaTraceView` on pass and in `SRSView.grade(_:)`.

- NavigationSplitView sections: PASS
  - `JapaneseBuddy/App/AppSidebar.swift` defines sections: Home, Lessons, Practice, Review, Stats, Settings, with destinations wired in `NavigationSplitView`.

## Notes / Optional Cleanup
- `AppSidebar` also sets a preferred color scheme; consider relying solely on root `.applyTheme` to avoid redundancy.
- Recommend a quick manual run in Xcode to validate runtime behavior for theme switching and Reduce Motion on device.
