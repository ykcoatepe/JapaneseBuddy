# Front-End Merge/Verify Report (v4)

ID: JP-FE-AUDIT
Version: 1.0
Style: concise, actionable

## Summary
Version 4 is integrated and verified against the requested checklist. I applied a small theme helper and root hook, and confirmed haptics, reduce‑motion guards, navigation, and lessons wiring. Duplicate Lessons view is not present (single `LessonListView`).

## Acceptance Checks
- App entry: PASS — `JapaneseBuddyProjApp` launches `AppSidebar()`, injects `.environmentObject(store/lessons)`, and sets `.tint(Color("AccentColor"))`.
- ThemeMode persisted + applied via helper at root: PASS — `DeckStore.State.themeMode` persists; added `ThemeApplier` + `applyTheme(_:)` and used at app root.
- UI tokens/components present: PASS — `UI/Theme.swift` + `UI/Components/*` in place; components used across views (e.g., `JBButton`, `JBCard`).
- Reduce Motion guard in tracing: PASS — `KanaTraceView` and `StrokePreviewView` skip animation when `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`.
- Haptics on Trace/SRS actions: PASS — `KanaTraceView.check()` and `SRSView.grade(_:)` call `Haptics.light()`.
- Sidebar routes: PASS — `AppSidebar` provides Home, Lessons, Practice, Review (SRS), Stats, Settings.
- Duplicate Lessons view removed: PASS — only `LessonListView.swift` remains; `LessonListRedesignedView.swift` not present.

## Quick File Pointers
- App entry: `JapaneseBuddyProj/JapaneseBuddyProj/JapaneseBuddyProjApp.swift`
- Sidebar: `JapaneseBuddy/App/AppSidebar.swift`
- Theme helper: `JapaneseBuddy/UI/Theme.swift` (`ThemeApplier`, `applyTheme(_:)`)
- Deck persistence + theme: `JapaneseBuddy/Services/DeckStore.swift`
- Tracing: `JapaneseBuddy/Features/KanaTraceView.swift`, `JapaneseBuddy/Services/StrokePreviewLayer.swift`
- SRS: `JapaneseBuddy/Features/SRS/SRSView.swift`
- Settings (theme picker): `JapaneseBuddy/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`
- Lessons list: `JapaneseBuddy/Features/Lessons/LessonListView.swift`

## Tiny Diffs Applied (≤30 LOC each)
1) Add theme helper and use at root
- File: `JapaneseBuddy/UI/Theme.swift`
  - Added:
    - `struct ThemeApplier: ViewModifier { let mode: ThemeMode ... }`
    - `extension View { func applyTheme(_:) -> some View }`
- File: `JapaneseBuddyProj/JapaneseBuddyProj/JapaneseBuddyProjApp.swift`
  - Added: `.applyTheme(store.themeMode)` in the root chain.

Notes: `AppSidebar` also computed a color scheme from `store.themeMode`. Applying at the root fulfills the checklist; the internal preference is harmless if left as-is.

## Items Requiring Manual Verification
- Target membership: Confirm all new/updated files are in the `JapaneseBuddyProj` target (UI/Theme, UI/Components, AppSidebar, StatsView, updated Home/Lessons/Runner/Trace/SRS/Settings) in Xcode.
- Build on device: Clean (⌥⇧⌘K) and run (⌘R) on iPad (portrait/landscape), test Light/Dark and Reduce Motion.

## On-Device Acceptance (2 min)
- Toggle System/Light/Dark in Settings → app retints and recolors live.
- Lessons list shows stars/step subtitle; Runner segmented header works.
- Trace: bottom bar fixed; pass rule unchanged; haptic on success; Reduce Motion stops preview animation.
- SRS: big card; grade buttons trigger haptics.
- Stats: 7‑day bars render (or `EmptyState` if fresh).
